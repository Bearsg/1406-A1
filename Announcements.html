  <h2><strong><em>Announcements </em></strong></h2>
  <p> We have some cool things happening that we want people to know about: this month you can purchase 3 drinks for the price of 2 at the bar. First-time party-goers get a 50% discount on entry If you get a costume custom made, your next party entry is free if you wear that costume. Wear your costume in to KFC on Stanton street and you can get a free drink with a 21-piece bucket. Tell them you’ve been to CossiePlay! </p>
  
  <h2>Party Guidelines</h2>
  <p>CossiePlay party-goers party at their own  risk and are responsible for their own safety. Check with your doctor before  you party hard.</p>
Party fees must be  paid at the door. Cash or EFTPOS accepted. Credit card payments attract a 2%  surcharge. Alcohol is served at the bar to over 18s only. No intoxicated  persons will be served, but will be escorted to a taxi – paid by the  party-goer.</div>
